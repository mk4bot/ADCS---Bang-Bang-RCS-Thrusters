# ADCS---Bang-Bang-RCS-Thrusters
A simulation of spacecraft attitude control using 12 RCS thrusters placed on the vertices of a cuboid-shaped 
spacecraft. 

## Discrete Element Implementation: Switches and Schmitt Triggers
Before attitude control can be performed using bang-bang control, the discrete elements must be implemented in 
Simulink and their behavior confirmed using graphical methods (phase portraits).
